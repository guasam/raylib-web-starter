# Raylib Web Starter

A custom project for building Raylib C++ (game engine) projects without hassle of the `PLATFORM_WEB`.

Try : https://guasam.github.io/raylib-web-starter

<br />

## What's the purpose?

The idea of creating this project came into mind just because there was a lack of documentation and build process etc for Raylib projects, specially when we need to compile and deploy the project for `PLATFORM_WEB` (HTML5)

<br />

## Requirements

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Raylib + Installer](https://www.raylib.com/)
* [emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
* [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) (Optional, for including raylib headers in `main.cpp` etc)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (Optional, for running various `scripts` for building and deployment)
